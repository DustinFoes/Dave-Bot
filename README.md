# Dave Bot
Dave Bot is a general use Discord bot made with Discord.py usingn Python3.10. This bot will have variety of functions and commands that will help anyone who is running a discord server with features like polls, python error detection, ticketing system, and more!
## Description
I started this as my first ever discord bot. As I started learning more and more I just wanted to add more things all the time. I thought that I would share this with anyone who may want to use this bot for their own purposes, or help add to the project. Over time I hope to add much more to the bot and continue making improvements. If you have any questions please visit my discord channel. https://discord.gg/mBmX292QnG
